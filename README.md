## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies and Installation

To get started, follow these steps to clone the repository, set up your environment, and install the required dependencies:

```bash
## Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/W-JG/BPOSR
cd BPOSR

## Create a conda environment
conda create -n BPOSR python=3.10
conda activate BPOSR

## Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Prepare Training and Testing Data

### Step 1: Download LAU Dataset
Download the LAU dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w7m1r-yCbbZ7_xMGzb6IBplPe4c89rH9) and place it in the `Dataset` directory.  
To extract the data, run:

```bash
unrar x lau_dataset.rar
```

### Step 2: Clean the Data
To clean the dataset, similar to [OSRT](https://github.com/Fanghua-Yu/OSRT/blob/master/odisr/utils/make_clean_lau_dataset.py), run the following command:

```bash
python Data_prepare/make_clean_lau_dataset.py
```

This will create a `lau_dataset_clean` folder inside the `Dataset` directory.

## üöÄ Quick Inference

### Step 1: Download Pretrained Models
Download the pretrained weights from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tj4d2oje6B1AT1Ty8G0mc1dJyxwMgrry?usp=sharing) and place them in the `BPOSR/experiments` folder.

### Step 2: Run the Testing Command
Use the following commands to test with different scales:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python basicsr/test.py -opt ./options/BPOSR_test/test_BPOSR_x4.yml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python basicsr/test.py -opt ./options/BPOSR_test/test_BPOSR_x8.yml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python basicsr/test.py -opt ./options/BPOSR_test/test_BPOSR_x16.yml
```

---

## üåà Training

#### Single GPU
For single-GPU training, run the following command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore basicsr/train.py -opt options/BPOSR_train/train_BPOSR_SW_SRx4.yml
```

#### Multi-GPU
For multi-GPU training, use the following command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="./:${PYTHONPATH}" CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -W ignore -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=4321 --use_env basicsr/train.py -opt options/BPOSR_train/train_BPOSR_SW_SRx4.yml --launcher pytorch
```

> **Note:** Be sure to modify the `train_BPOSR_SW_SRx4.yml` file and set `num_gpu: 4` accordingly.
